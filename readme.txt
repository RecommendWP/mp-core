== Description ==

A plugin for developers which contains a group of classes and functions used to power plugins and themes. The idea here is keeping all the code that we re-use over and over, and keeping it in one place so it never needs to be re-written - saving time and being efficient.

On its own this plugin doesn’t actually do anything. Rather, it’s functions and classes can be utilized by other plugins and themes.
